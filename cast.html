        <p>"The Truman Show" was directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol. The film was produced by Scott
          Rudin, Andrew Niccol, Edward S. Feldman, and Adam Schroeder. The movie was released by Paramount Pictures on
          June 5, 1998.</p>
        <p>The movie was filmed primarily in Seaside, Florida, a planned community designed in the New Urbanism style,
          which gave the film its iconic small-town feel. The film's production design was created by Dennis Gassner,
          who worked to create a realistic, believable world for Truman to inhabit.</p>
        <p>The film's score was composed by Philip Glass and is known for its hauntingly beautiful melodies. The film's
          soundtrack also features songs from various artists, including "How Deep Is Your Love" by the Bee Gees and
          "All I Want" by Toad the Wet Sprocket.</p>
